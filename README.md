	- The highest EV sales are in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Delhi, and Goa.
	- The lowest EV sales are in East Indian states like Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Andaman & Nicobar.
- Category Preferences:
	- Delhi: Higher demand for 4-wheelers due to better infrastructure and favorable government policies.
	- Goa: Similar demand for both 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers.
- Seasonality:
	- Peak demand: March (end of financial year).
	- Low demand: May and June (likely due to extreme weather).

	- Strengthen 4-wheeler market strategy in Delhi and increase 2-wheeler outreach in Goa.
	- Karnataka’s EV subsidies and strong infrastructure make it a great manufacturing hub, while Tamil Nadu’s 20% capital subsidy and other incentives make it an ideal choice for setting up a unit.
	- Expanding charging infrastructure could boost EV sales in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala, which also provide capital subsidies for it.
    	- Introduce targeted marketing campaigns in underperforming regions (e.g., North East India)
